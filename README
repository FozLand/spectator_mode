This mod allows you to watch other players in their 3rd person view (spectator mode).
You're invisible and undetectable for the players when you're in this mode.

Can be useful for admins or moderators in their task of monitoring.

Requires the privilege "watch".

Commands :

/watch <player name>
/unwatch (get back to your initial position)
